/* The desired timer interrupt frequency is provided by the definition
 * CLK_TCK (see include/time.h).  CLK_TCK defines the desired number of
 * system clock ticks per second.  That value is a user configurable setting
 * that defaults to 100 (100 ticks per second = 10 MS interval).
 *
 * ITU1 operates in periodic timer mode.  TCNT counts up until it matches
 * the value of GRA0, then an interrupt is generated.  Two values must be
 * computed:
 *
 * (1) The divider that determines the rate at which TCNT increments, and
 * (2) The value of GRA0 that cause the interrupt to occur.
 *
 * These must be selected so that the frequency of interrupt generation is
 * CLK_TCK.  Ideally, we would like to use the full range of GRA0 for better
 * timing acuracy:
 */

#define DESIRED_GRA0     65535

/* The ideal divider would be one that generates exactly 65535 ticks in
 * 1/CLK_TCK seconds.  For example, if RX_CLOCK is 10MHz and CLK_TCK is
 * 100, then the ideal divider must be less greater than or equal to:
 *
 *   (10,000,000 / CLK_TCK) / 65535 = 1.525
 *
 * The actual selected divider would then have to be 2, resulting in a
 * counting rate of 5,000,0000 and a GRA0 setting of 50,000.
